  "description.machine_max.blueprint.ae86": "The AE86 is a compact, lightweight, and economically oriented car produced by Toyota, introduced in 1983 as part of the fourth-generation COROLLA lineup. In 1978, Toyota launched the TERCEL, marking the beginning of a shift in small car designâ€”from the structurally simple but costlier and space-consuming FR (front-engine, rear-wheel-drive) layout to the more complex yet cost-effective FF (front-engine, front-wheel-drive) configuration, driven by advancements in automotive technology.",
  "description.machine_max.blueprint.ae86at": "This AE86 has been upgraded with a four-wheel-drive drivetrain, a more powerful engine, a matching gearbox, and all-terrain tires, giving it significantly enhanced off-road capability.",
